This subdirectory ('tools') contains modules and scripts for
maintaining the code that is autogenerated from the upstream
GSW-Matlab and GSW-C repos.  The scripts are to be run from
this directory; they make assumptions about where they
are, and about where upstream repos are.  Specifically, it
is assumed that GSW-Matlab, GSW-C, and GSW-Python git repos
are all in the same base directory.

Scripts
-------
- copy_from_GSW-C.py: copies the relevant .c and .h files from a
    sibling GSW-C repo, if the latter are newer.
- mat2npz.py: generates an npz file in gsw/tests containing the
    test data and check values from the gsw_data_v3_0.mat file
    in the sibling GSW-Matlab repo.
- make_ufuncs.py: Generates the src/_ufuncs.c file to turn the
    scalar C functions into numpy ufuncs.  It writes ufuncs.list
    in the current directory as a record of the ufunc names.
    Functions are identified as ufunc candidates based on their
    signatures, parsed from src/c_gsw/gswteos-10.h.
- make_wrapped_ufuncs.py: Generates gsw/_wrapped_ufuncs.py based on
    the output of make_ufuncs.py.  It adds docstrings constructed
    from the Matlab help text.
- fix_wrapped_ufunc_typos.py: Fixes docstring typos that have been
    identified, but not yet fixed, in the GSW-Matlab repo.
- codegen: Runs the last three python scripts.

Modules
-------
- c_header_parser.py: Functions for taking apart the function
    declarations in gswteos-10.h.
- matlab_parser.py: Functions specifically for reading the GSW-Matlab
    function signatures and for splitting out the help text.
- docstring_parts.py: Blocks of text for assembling docstrings.
- docstring_utils.py: Functions for assembling docstrings in numpydoc
    format.
- categories.py: Functions for listing gsw function names by category.
    This is not used by any of the other functions or scripts, but
    was used when initially categorizing the functions for inclusion
    in submodules.

Notes
-----
- In addition to the generated src/_ufuncs.c, there are two C files
    that are hand-written: src/method_bodies.c and src/method_def_entries.c.
    These are imported by src/_ufuncs.c. They handle some C functions
    that are not suitable for ufuncs.
- Specialized Matlab parsing is also done in gsw/tests/check_functions.py,
    which is used by gsw/tests/test_check_functions.py; see the docstring
    of the former for more info.
